  eventTitle: Someone is missing
  eventText: At night, the Griffith Observatory is exceptionally quiet under the
    moonlight. The scenery here is undoubtedly beautiful, but one can clearly hear
    the faint sounds of a distant zombie horde. It seems like it's time to leave
    this place as soon as possible. Unfortunately, Joanna Stones realizes there's
    one less person in the group...
